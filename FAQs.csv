"Supply Chain Management (SCM)","If the Procurement Practitioner makes a negotiation amendment adding more requirements, which is the new deadline? Is there any minimum of days?","If any amendments need to be made in the solicitation document (including requirements, TOR and Specification), UN Women should give all bidders a reasonable extension of the deadline as bidders who have already submitted the bid will be required to re-submit it in the system (all bids submitted before the amendment of the negotiation will be archived). The policy and procedure do not give a blanket duration for such extension. It should be considered and adjusted on case-by-case basis. 

The relevant provisions are below:
